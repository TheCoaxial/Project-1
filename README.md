# The Wonderful World of Food and Cocktails (WIP Name)
This is a shared repository for a group project assigned by a coding boot camp. 

The purpose of this project was to create a website that used 2 seperate API's and a css framework other than Bootstrap, we chose Foundation. 

We chose to use themealDB and thecocktailDB to create a website to search for recipes for meals and drinks. 

As well as searching manually a user can select a button to select a random meal for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner. 

There are also 2 buttons to select a random alcoholic or non-alcoholic cocktail.
